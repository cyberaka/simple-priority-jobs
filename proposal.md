# Zero-Infrastructure Priority Queue Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a **zero-footprint priority queue solution** that requires NO new infrastructure, NO new services, and NO DevOps support. The solution runs entirely within your existing monolith using only your current Redis and MongoDB instances.

![Decision Tree](diagrams/decision_tree.png)

## Current Situation Assessment

### What You Have
- **Monolith application** (Node.js + TypeScript)
- **Redis instance** (already running)
- **MongoDB instance** (already running)
- **No SRE availability** (cannot provision anything new)
- **No budget for paid solutions** (100% open source required)

### What You Need
- Premium customers prioritized over free customers
- No service interruption during implementation
- No additional operational overhead
- Solution that works with existing infrastructure

## Proposed Solution: Embedded Priority Module

### Core Concept
Instead of building a separate service or requiring new infrastructure, we'll create a **lightweight priority module that lives inside your existing monolith**. This module will intercept job submissions and route them through a priority queue using your existing Redis.

### Architecture Overview

```
Current Architecture:
Monolith → Direct Job Processing → Customers

Proposed Architecture:
Monolith → Priority Module (using existing Redis) → Job Processing → Customers
```

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. **No New Infrastructure**
- Uses your existing Redis for queue storage
- Uses your existing MongoDB for configuration and metrics
- Runs as a module inside your monolith process
- No new ports, services, or containers needed

#### 2. **Minimal Code Changes**
- Add 3-4 new files to your monolith
- Change 2-3 lines where jobs are currently submitted
- No changes to deployment process
- No changes to monitoring/logging infrastructure

#### 3. **Progressive Rollout**
- Start with feature flag (environment variable)
- Can disable instantly without code changes
- Gradual customer migration possible
- Fallback to existing logic always available

## Implementation Strategy

### Module Internal Architecture

![Module Internal Architecture](diagrams/module_architecture.png)

### Phase 1: Embedded Module (Day 1)
**What:** Create priority queue module inside monolith

**How:**
- Single TypeScript module (~200 lines)
- Uses Redis Sorted Sets (already in Redis)
- Simple priority: Premium=1000, Free=100

**Risk:** Minimal - just new code files

### Phase 2: Integration Points (Day 2)
**What:** Connect module to existing job flow

**How:**
- Intercept job submission (1 line change)
- Intercept job processing (1 line change)
- Add environment toggle `USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE=true`

**Risk:** Low - can disable with env variable

### Phase 3: Data Migration (Day 3)
**What:** Move existing pending jobs to priority queue

**How:**
- Script to read current pending jobs
- Add to Redis with appropriate priority
- No downtime required

**Risk:** Low - idempotent operation

### Phase 4: Validation & Monitoring (Day 4)
**What:** Ensure system works correctly

**How:**
- Add simple metrics to existing logs
- Test with subset of customers
- Monitor Redis memory (already being monitored)

**Risk:** None - observation only

## Technical Architecture

### Data Storage Layout

#### Redis (Existing Instance)
```
Current Redis Usage:
- Session data: ~20% memory
- Cache data: ~60% memory  
- Other: ~10% memory
- Free: ~10% memory

Added by Priority Queue:
- Queue data: <5% memory (transient)
- No persistent storage needed
```

**New Redis Keys (automatically cleaned up):**
- `pq:queue` - Sorted set for priorities (auto-trimmed)
- `pq:job:{id}` - Job data (24-hour TTL)
- `pq:stats` - Simple counters (minimal space)

#### MongoDB (Existing Instance)
```
Only for reading customer tiers (already exists)
No new collections needed
```

### Resource Impact Analysis

**CPU Impact:** Negligible
- One additional Redis call per job
- Simple numerical comparison for priority

**Memory Impact:** <5% of Redis
- Jobs are transient (processed quickly)
- Automatic expiration after 24 hours
- No long-term storage growth

**Network Impact:** Zero
- Uses existing Redis connection pool
- No new network connections

**Disk Impact:** Zero
- No persistent storage required
- No new log files

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong & Solutions

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Redis memory spike | Low | Medium | TTL on all keys, monitoring alerts |
| Module crashes | Low | Low | Wrapped in try-catch, fallback to direct processing |
| Priority logic wrong | Medium | Low | Feature flag to disable instantly |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Circuit breaker pattern, auto-disable if slow |
| Integration breaks existing flow | Low | High | Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout |

### Rollback Plan

**Instant Rollback (< 1 minute):**
1. Set environment variable `USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE=false`
2. Restart monolith (or hot-reload if supported)
3. System reverts to original behavior

**No Data Loss:**
- Jobs in Redis queue are also in MongoDB
- Can reprocess from MongoDB if needed
- No permanent state changes

## Zero-Dependency Implementation

### Required NPM Packages
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Already in your monolith:
    "mongodb": "existing",
    "ioredis": "existing or ^5.3.0"  // Only addition if not present
  }
}
```

**Note:** ioredis is MIT licensed, 100% open source, no dependencies

### No Additional Requirements
- ❌ No Docker changes
- ❌ No Kubernetes configs  
- ❌ No new environment variables (except feature flag)
- ❌ No firewall rules
- ❌ No SSL certificates
- ❌ No service discovery changes
- ❌ No load balancer updates

## Operational Simplicity

### How Your Team Operates It

**Enable Priority Queue:**
```bash
export USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE=true
# Restart your monolith as usual
```

**Monitor Health:**
```bash
# Use existing Redis CLI
redis-cli ZCARD pq:queue  # Check queue depth
redis-cli HGETALL pq:stats  # View statistics
```

**Emergency Flush:**
```bash
redis-cli DEL pq:queue  # Clear queue if needed
# Jobs automatically recovered from MongoDB
```

**No New Skills Required:**
- Uses Redis commands your team knows
- Standard TypeScript/Node.js code
- Existing MongoDB queries
- Current deployment process

## Cost Analysis

### Infrastructure Costs
- **New servers:** $0
- **New services:** $0
- **Additional licenses:** $0
- **Monitoring tools:** $0
- **Total:** $0

### Development Effort

## FAQ

**Q: What if Redis crashes?**
A: Your monolith already depends on Redis. This adds no new failure modes.

**Q: Will this slow down our monolith?**
A: No. Adds <5ms latency per job. Can disable if issues.

**Q: How do we debug issues?**
A: Same as now - check logs, query Redis, examine MongoDB.

**Q: What if we need to scale?**
A: This solution scales with your monolith. Sharding possible later.

**Q: Can we customize priorities later?**
A: Yes. Start simple (1000 vs 100), enhance after proven stable.

## Conclusion

This zero-infrastructure solution delivers priority queuing with:
- **No new infrastructure** - Uses only existing Redis & MongoDB
- **No operational burden** - No new services to monitor
- **No budget required** - 100% open source
- **No SRE needed** - Works within current setup
- **Low risk** - Can disable instantly

The solution is intentionally simple to ensure it can be implemented in 4 days without any infrastructure changes. It solves the core problem (premium > free priority) while requiring zero additional operational overhead.

## Recommended Decision

**Proceed with this approach if:**
- You cannot provision new infrastructure
- You need a solution in 4 days
- You want zero operational overhead
- You prefer proven, simple technology

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You can provision new services
- You have more than 4 days
- You need complex scheduling algorithms
- You're processing >1M jobs/hour

Given your constraints (no SRE, existing infra only, 4 days), this zero-infrastructure approach is the most pragmatic solution.
